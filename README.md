# Evaluates algebraic expressions.

# How it works:
1. Seperates the expressions into tokens (numbers, operators, symbols)
2. Converts the infix notation expression to postifx notation (Reverse Polish Notation) using the Shunting Yard algorithm
3. Evaluates the postfix notation expression

# #TODO
- Add support for functions (sqrt, sin, cos)
